/**
 * <p>GameDivision is feature allowing you to cut your game in different parts.</p>
 * <p>Each part is defined in a list, belongs to an attribute number corresponding to the index of the list. <p>
 * 
 * <p>A part is defined by a {@link StateChangeAction} instance, we highly recommand you to create your own class
 * implementing StateChangeAction but you can also make a direct instance of it and completing the methods overrided.</p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * GameDivisions owns an under feature named JoinLeaveManager. 
 * To use this under feature, you basically
 * have to create a {@link JoinLeaveManager} instance and to link it.
 * Then, when you add a {@link StateChangeAction} you can also
 * implements a {@link JoinLeaveAction}, which is going to be automatically linked with the state.
